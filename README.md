This project is part of the `gecode-bindings` organization on GitHub.  It
distributes as YAML files prototypes of function for posting Gecode propagators,
as well as useful enums.  It also provides code for automatically extracting
such information from any version of gecode.

You need to have gecode, python3 and doxygen installed.  Then execute:
```
make clean
make
```

and 2 new files appear in the data subdirectory for your version of gecode.
